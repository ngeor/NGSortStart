Hi, my name is Nick Georgiou and I am a Greek student. This file contains some information on the NGSortStart program I wrote. Actually, I just had to put something in the zip file besides the program itself :-)

What does the program do?
----------------------------
NGSortStart sorts the Windows 98 Start Menu. You may have noticed that some times Windows add your program groups at the bottom of the Programs menu. This really bugs me... I want to have all my groups in the top of the Programs menu! And I also want to have my programs sorted alphabetically! I know that in Windows 98 you can drag & drop menu items in the Start Menu but that can be really boring :-(
That's why I wrote NGSortStart. It sorts everything in the Start Menu and it gives me the menu I really want!

Warning!
-----------
USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK! I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA LOSS OR OTHER KIND OF DAMAGE CAUSED TO YOUR COMPUTER. THIS PROGRAM IS ONLY MENT TO WORK RIGHT ON WINDOWN 98! I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU RUN IT ON WINDOWS 95/NT!
Actually, nothing ever happened to my computer, but just in case something goes wrong... after all it is Windows :-)

FREEWARE!
------------
This program is freeware! That means you don't have to pay anything for it and you can't make any money out of it. However donations will be deeply esteemed. Feel free to give it to your friends, but you must always give the original zip file. If you want to put this program in a shareware collection, I would really appreciate it if you send me a ***FREE*** copy of the collection.
That's it!
